Using auto height does solve this most of the time but sometimes the content inside the iframe is fully dynamic too (like a video which does scale). If this is the case you can define a ratio here. e.g. 0.5 means that if you have a width of 1000 you have a height of 500. If the width changes to 800 the height changes to 400.

"         If you want to have different iframe configurations depending on the browser you have to use the shortcode attribute <strong>browser=\"\"</strong> and define the browsers there which should be used for this shortcode. See the different <a href=\"#config-options\">configuration options</a> below. You can define several browsers by separaring them by, and even define browser versions by adding the versions with (version). Each of the shortcodes which are browser dependent need to have the <strong>same id</strong>! The last shortcode should have the attribute browser=\"default\". This is then used if no browser does match before. If you don't do this you can show iframes only for a specific browser.\n"

"     One advantage of the iframe communcation is that by default you see the callbacks to height.html in the network. So is was always easy to debug out of the box. window.postMessage by default is not visible like that. If you have any problems with window.postMessage select \"Debug\" at \"Use postMessage communication\" and log information about the transfered data is printed to the browser console. Use F12 at your browser to open the developer tools. \n"

"      <h3>What are jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"      jQuery selectors are one of the most important aspects of the jQuery library. These selectors use familiar CSS syntax to allow page authors to quickly and easily identify any set of page elements to operate upon with the jQuery library methods. Understanding jQuery selectors is the key to using the jQuery library most effectively. The selector is a string expression that identifies the set of DOM elements that will be collected into a matched set to be operated upon by the jQuery methods.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"           <h3>Types of jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"        There are three categories of jQuery selectors: Basic CSS selectors, Positional selectors, and Custom jQuery selectors.\n"
"      </p><p>\n"
"The Basic Selectors are known as \"find selectors\" as they are used to find elements within the DOM. The Positional and Custom Selectors are \"filter selectors\" as they filter a set of elements (which defaults to the entire set of elements in the DOM). This extract will focus on the basic selectors as they are most important and will cover most of your needs.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Basic CSS Selectors</h4>\n"
"      <p>These selectors follow standard CSS3 syntax and semantics. For more selectors and examples go to <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors\" target=\"_blank\">http://api.jquery.com//category/selectors</a>.</p>\n"

This can be on click, by an Ajax call, typing with the keyboard where a menu opens, a timer .... So actually any change of the size. The big advantage is that this feature is most of the time easier to configure than the options before and also more powerful. But it has the disadvantage that the change of the size is not send by an event but the defined elements are checked in a fix interval (see below). So e.g. every 100ms a certain div is checked and if the size has changed the iframe is resized.<br />If you only specify \"body\" then the iframe does enlarge nicely but does not get smaller anymore. Therefore you should not use this! The best way to configure this is to use the outermost element where the change can happen. Please see example 26 for a working example. This feature does also trigger all css/js modifications inside the iframe again! You can use the jQuery syntax to specify the elements. Most likely the outermost div (e.g. #main, #page, #wrap) is the one you need. This feature is also available in the external workaround while \"Resize on click events\" and \"Resize on AJAX events\" not yet! Shortcode attribute: resize_on_element_resize=\"\""

This is very often the case when tabs are used and you place an iframe on a tab that is not shown by default.

To get this working you need to provide the id or class of the tab that is hidden and depending on the tabs plugin also the id or class of the tab that is visible by default to get the correct width. Please read the section \"<a class=\"howto-id-link\" href=\"#\">How to find the id and the attributes</a>\" to find the right id or class. E.g.
